<p>If you’re interested in a career in the Professional Truck Driving Industry, and you’ve met all <a href="cdl-requirements.php">CDL training requirements</a>, congratulations! You’re considering entering a growing profession with some incredible benefits:</p>
<ul class="yes-bullet">
<li><strong>Starting pay averaging $40,000 per year</strong> - <span class="s1">First year drivers average $40,000 to $45,000 their first year.* </span>Considering that you could earn your Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) in as little as <a href="blog/3-4-weeks-truck-driver-training-school-enough/">3-4 weeks</a>, the decision seems pretty simple!</li>
<li><b>Job Security </b>- Truck driver jobs can't be outsourced. Truck drivers are responsible for dispersing America’s goods and necessities across the states, and are needed throughout the nation. <a href="http://www.trucking.org/ATA%20Docs/News%20and%20Information/Reports%20Trends%20and%20Statistics/10%206%2015%20ATAs%20Driver%20Shortage%20Report%202015.pdf">The ATA estimates</a> a shortage of nearly 48,000 truck drivers, and the demand is expected to continue rising throughout the decade.</li>
<li><strong>Medical Insurance and Dental Insurance</strong> - A position as a truck driver comes with many benefits that may be specific to each carrier. Medical and dental insurance are common perks in the truck driving industry. </li>
<li><strong>401k Retirement Savings Plan</strong> - Earn money for retirement as you navigate the highway! </li>
<li><strong>Life Insurance</strong> - Enjoy competitive options for life insurance depending on your carrier of choice! </li>
<li><strong>Paid Vacation and Sick Time</strong> - Professional truck drivers need vacation time to unwind from work and sick time to recover from illnesses. The amount of paid time off a driver receives depends on the carrier's offerings, and carriers are competing to have you on their team!</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Schedule</strong> - The type of license you earn (<a href="cdl_training_class-a.php">Class A CDL or Class B CDL</a>) and whether you choose a position with local or long distance runs are factors affecting schedule. Luckily, you can control what professional direction to take by being able to choose your carrier! </li>
<li><strong>Changing Scenery</strong> - See the country while getting paid! Professional Truck Drivers call the open road their place of business and are privileged to cross-country sights that many are not. Travel coast-to-coast and peak-to-peak! See all the wonderful scenery America has to offer!</li>
<li><strong>Take your pet with you on the road!</strong> - If leaving your pet at home during runs isn't an option, consider taking them on your trips! Certain carriers allow truck drivers to bring their pets as travel buddies. </li>
<li><strong>Team Driving</strong> - This allows couples and friends to drive in shifts and earn more money. With a partner, you can accept longer drives and more hours since switching spots is all it takes to keep on trucking! </li>
</ul>

<h2>Driver Pay</h2>
<p>The current driver shortage means opportunities for professional truck drivers to make more money! Many factors contribute to a driver's salary (things like type of driving, bonuses, and mileage) so determining driver pay isn't a "one size fits all" situation. To learn more about how driver pay is determined, see <a href="how-much-do-truck-drivers-make.php">How Much Do Truck Drivers Make</a>.</p>
<p>Great pay isn't the only <a href="blog/three-reasons-why-you-should-become-a-professional-truck-driver/">reason you should consider becoming a professional truck driver</a>. The relatively easy-to-earn Class A CDL license, the incredible opportunities for travel, and the high demand for drivers are just a few!</p>
<h3>Professional Truck Drivers are in Demand!</h3>
<p>Globalization affects jobs all across the country. The good news is professional truck driving is a career that can't be outsourced! An overseas worker can't transport the goods and necessities needed here in America. Because of that, and due to renewed production and an improving economy, truck drivers are in high demand! Although many men and women <a href="blog/truck-driver-common-job-state-reason/">are already Class A CDL trained truck drivers</a>, many more are required to meet the country's growing needs.</p>
<p>Some perks that come with the current demand are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Truck drivers should encounter a favorable job market.</li>
<li>New job openings should be abundant as the demand for driving a truck increases!</li>
<li>As the industry loses drivers due to retirement, new job opportunities arise.</li>
<li>Pay &amp; Benefit packages continue to become more lucrative.</li>
</ul>
