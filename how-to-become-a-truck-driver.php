<h3>Financial Assistance</h3>
<p>A major benefit of Roadmaster is that we offer financial assistance if needed, for those who qualify. In addition to financing options, we work with numerous trucking companies who offer tuition reimbursement programs and more!</p>
<h6>Tuition Reimbursement</h6>
<p>Trainees pay tuition fees for their Class A CDL courses up front, and are then free to choose a carrier that offers tuition reimbursement. Some of our partner carriers offer up to 90% tuition reimbursement to new hires. The reimbursement amount varies from carrier to carrier, and should be carefully looked at when selecting your applications.</p>

<h3>What is a Pre-Hire Letter?</h3>
<h6>why the high demand?</h6>
<p>Representatives from top-name carriers make frequent visits to Roadmaster facilities, typically with at least one rep from a core carrier visiting each week. This way, trainees can learn more about carriers and can interact with other industry professionals and ask important career questions.</p>
<p>From the carrier standpoint, representatives can come check out potential future talent and sell their best pitch. There is a big demand for Class A CDL trained truck drivers, and carriers compete with each other and provide interested drivers incentives and great benefits.</p>
