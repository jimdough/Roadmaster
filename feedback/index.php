			  	  <h1>Have you experienced difficulties with Roadmaster Drivers School?</h1>
			  	  <p>Are you feeling ripped off and thinking of venting on Facebook, RipOffReport, and Pissed Consumer? We take every complaint very seriously and will do everything possible to resolve the situation.</p>
 
<p>Roadmaster is not in any way a scam, hoax, or ripoff. Alternatively, its CDL training courses seek to provide students with information and resources aimed at success in the Professional Truck Driving Industry. We understand that not everyoneâ€™s Roadmaster experience is identical. However, we expect the same level of attention, dedication, and competency from all of our nation-wide truck driving schools and wish to be notified if performing below standards.</p>
 
<p>Here on our Roadmaster Feedback Page, individuals can voice their concerns and complaints directly to corporate officials so that their issues can be investigated. By learning what we need to improve on, we can make sure that Roadmaster continues to meet the needs of its students.</p>
