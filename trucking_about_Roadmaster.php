<h3>Roadmaster Drivers School is a Truck Driving & CDL Training school</h3>

<p> Roadmaster Drivers School's formula for success is simple. We are an industry leading <b>cdl training company</b> that provides experienced truck driving school instructors and offers students comprehensive <b>cdl classes</b> and behind the wheel truck driving education so they are fully prepared to start their new job in the trucking industry. By focusing on giving students the best education and maintaining high job placement standards, Roadmaster has gained a national reputation in the trucking industry for quality training of entry-level commercial truck drivers.</p>
  
<h3>Our students set the standard for safety everywhere they drive.</h3>

 <p>You can usually recognize a Roadmaster trained truck driver by the amount of care he or she takes with their truck, their parking technique, backing up, passing and safety skills. We consider our training practices to be the most hands-on and safety-focused training in the country. Roadmaster ranks ahead of it's <b>truck driving school</b> competitors by grounding itself in old-fashioned hard work, maintaining strong relationships with big-name carriers and offering total <a href="truck_school_admissions.php">student assistance</a> before, during, and after their <a href="cdl_training.php">cdl classes</a>.</p> 
 
<p>As a cdl training company, Roadmaster takes it's responsibility very seriously when it comes to training it's students. In May 1992: Roadmaster Drivers School opened its first school at the Florida State Fairgrounds location in <a href="truck_school_TAMPA.php">Tampa, Florida.</a> During its first year of operation, the <b>cdl training company</b> obtained a license to perform as a third party Commercial Driver Licensing Examiner for the State of Florida. Focusing on maintaining high education and placement standards, the school gained a national reputation in the trucking industry for quality training of entry-level commercial truck drivers.</p>

<p>Roadmaster began evaluating sites for a second school. After conducting various demographic studies, Columbus, Ohio was chosen as the location in October 1995, for the company's second driving school. In November 1997, <a href="http://www.careerpathtraining.com">Career Path Training</a> continued its expansion efforts for Roadmaster and opened a training school in <a href="truck_school_JACKSONVILLE.php">Jacksonville, Florida</a> offering our state of the art cdl classes. In 2002, <a href="truck_school_SaltLake.php">Roadmaster Drivers School of Salt Lake City, Inc</a> and <a href="truck_school_SANANTONIO.php">Roadmaster Drivers School of San Antonio, Inc.</a> began school operations. In September 2004, Roadmaster Drivers School became a training partner with <a href="http://www.midsouthcc.edu/">Mid South Community College</a> and opened a commercial truck driver program on the campus in West Memphis, Arkansas.</p>

<p>In 2005, Roadmaster Drivers School opened a commercial truck driver training program in Columbus, Indiana. The school was relocated to <a href="truck_school_INDIANA.php">Indianapolis</a> in January 2007. Later that same year, Roadmaster acquired Interstate Driving Academy and opened a new cdl training company location in <a href="truck_school_northcarolina.php">Dunn, North Carolina</a>. In 2009, we opened school locations in <a href="truck_school_Tulsa.php">Tulsa, Oklahoma</a> and its first school location in California in the city of <a href="truck_school_fontanaCalifornia.php">Fontana</a>. In 2011 Roadmaster Drivers School opened its first school location in <a href="truck_school_Chattanooga_Tennessee.php">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a></p>
 
<p class="radius panel testimonial">"Our students are the most important people on our premises. They are not dependent on us, we are dependent on them. They are not an interruption of our work, they are the purpose of it. They are not an outsider of our school, they are part of it. We are not doing them a favor by training them, they are doing us a favor by giving us an opportunity to do so. They are the reason we exist."<br /><br />
