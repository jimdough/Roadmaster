<p>After completing a truck driver training courses, you will test for your <a href="cdl_training_class-a.php">Commercial Driver’s License (CDL)</a>. Those who pass the exam typically move on to apply to jobs. However at <strong>Roadmaster</strong>, students work with our <a href="job-placement.php">job placement assistance</a> counselors from day one. It is very likely that a qualified student will get pre-hired while still in training!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Job placement</strong><span style="font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.4em;"> – Roadmaster’s <a href="job-placement.php">Job Placement assistance</a> teaches you how to fill out carrier applications and let’s you <a href="carrier-choice.php">choose from top-name carriers</a> to apply to. You’re free to apply to those carriers that fit the lifestyle you would like to live. After Roadmaster’s CDL training, you’re in control of your future!</span></li>
<li><strong>Pre-hire</strong><span style="font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.4em;"> – Carriers may respond to applications with offers even while trainees are still in school. You could very well sign on with a top-name trucking company in your first week of CDL training at Roadmaster! <a href="what-is-a-pre-hire-letter.php">Pre-hiring</a> is a way for carriers to ensure their partnerships with great drivers, and pre-hired drivers can finish classes with the next stage of their journey already planned out!</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Post graduation training at new location</h2>
<p><a href="blog/what-to-expect-after-your-cdl-training/">After graduating from Roadmaster</a> and obtaining your Class A CDL, you will train on-site with your chosen carrier. While each carrier is different, new drivers in on-site training can expect things like </p>
<ul>
<li>A few hundred hours behind the wheel with a certified company trainer</li>
<li>Training salary beginning on the first day of orientation</li>
<li>Advanced trucking techniques and in-depth know-how</li>
<li>Details about carrier trucking fleet and the individual truck trainee will drive</li>
</ul>
<p>This final stage of training prepares Class A CDL drivers for a successful career with their carrier and beyond. Once it is completed, the trainee becomes the Professional Truck Driver and can look at options for solo and <a href="blog/partner-driving-offers-income-and-lifestyle-opportunities/">team driving.</a></p>
