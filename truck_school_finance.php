			  <h1>Cost of Truck Driving School</h1>
			  <p>A major benefit of Roadmaster is that we offer financial assistance if needed, for those who qualify. In addition to financing options, we work with numerous trucking companies who offer tuition reimbursement programs and more!</p>

			  <p>Roadmaster has frequent on-site visits from trucking companies and their Driver Recruiters. Each of these Recruiters meet with students during their training and provide information about what their company offers when it comes to pay rates and bonuses, opportunities and driving options available to you, the schedules and home time, the benefits and other perks!</p>

				
				<h3>Tuition Costs and Fee Highlights</h3>
				
				<p>As stated in the enrollment agreement and addendum for each state, tuition cost includes the registration fee, books and supplies. Career guidance and job placement assistance are also provided to students and/or graduates at no extra charge. Students are responsible for travel, meals, housing (if required) and incidental expenses not directly related to training.</p>
				
				<p>To get started with your CDL A training and driving a truck, just fill out our contact form to set up an appointment with an admissions representative. They will be able to tell you exactly how much is truck driving school as well as any other questions you may have about driving a truck.</p>
				
				<h3>Incomplete Policy</h3>
				
				<p>Any student not completing the training within the prescribed time frame is eligible for a refund of tuition based on the applicable state refund policy.
				A student who withdraws or is withdrawn is eligible for a refund of tuition based on the applicable state refund policy.</p>
								
				<h3>Veteran Policies</h3>
				
				<p>Student eligibility for Veterans Education Benefits is established by the Veterans Administration. Initial eligibility and continued eligibility during enrollment is determined by the VA.</p>
				
				<h6>Veterans' Refund Policy</h6>
				
				<p>The refund of the unused portion of tuition, fees, and other charges for veterans or eligible persons who fail to enter a course, withdraw or discontinue prior to completion, will be made for all amounts paid which exceed the approximate pro rata portion of the total charges that the length of the completed portion bears to the total length of the course. The proration will be determined on the ratio of days or hours of instruction completed to the total number of instructional days or hours in the course.</p>
