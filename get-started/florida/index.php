	  	  <h1>Why are truck drivers so in demand?</h1>
<p>The answer is simple…professional truck drivers deliver the goods that keep America and our economy moving!  Truck driving is not just a job that can pay well; it is the beginning of a professional career, and the fastest road to success. The shortage is not due to a lack of interest, just basic economics – the demand for professional truck drivers is growing faster than the number of new drivers entering the field and is a profession that cannot be outsourced!</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the truck driving occupation to grow faster than the average of all occupations and the number of heavy truck and tractor-trailer drivers is expected to rise by 330,100, or 21%, between 2010 and 2020.  The DOL/BLS Employment Projections program forecasts almost 2 million heavy truck/tractor-trailer drivers will be needed by 2020!  Changes in federal regulations and increased competition from other sectors of the economy are forcing major changes in the trucking industry.  Those changes, in addition to retiring drivers, are putting a premium on new drivers and may result in increased compensation. </p>

				  <h3>Truck Driver Salary & Benefits</h3>
			  <p>A career as a truck driver can offer an individual a way to go from unemployed or underemployed to a middle class lifestyle quickly.
