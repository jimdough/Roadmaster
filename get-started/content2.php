<h2>How Much Money Do Truck Drivers Make?</h2>

<p>To some, the money you make as a truck driver is just the cherry on top of the sundae. It’s that decisive extra weight on the scale that tips the balance in favor of the one behind the wheel, making all the hours more than worth the driver’s time.</p>

<p>Yet even for all the men and women who are focused solely on the piles of cash that are up for grabs amid the current truck driver shortage, Trucking is the perfect chance to climb from their current lives, unemployed or underemployed and longing for more, to a comfortable middle-class standard they can truly be proud to call their own as they support themselves and their families with it.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at how much money truck drivers make, and why any upfront costs are just a drop in the bucket compared to what you stand to make on the upside as a qualified, well-trained professional truck driver.</p>

<h2>Average Salary</h2>

<p>One of the biggest questions we get from potential students considering a career in Trucking is, “How much money do truck drivers make?”</p>

<p>The short answer is that the average salary for professional truck drivers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is almost $40,000 per year.</p>

<p>Of course, you’ll have a ton of opportunities to make significantly more than that. In fact, one of the best parts about Trucking is that, to a large extent, you can control your income by deciding how much work you put in and striving to hit milestones and goals.</p>

<p>Here are just some of the factors that help you to determine your own salary:</p>

<ul>
	
<li><h2>Bonuses</h2>

<p>One of the most sought-after sources of income for truck drivers is bonuses. There are all kinds of bonus incentives in Trucking. You can earn extra money for signing on with a carrier, hitting a certain number of miles, referring other drivers and more.</p></li>

<li><h2>Mileage</h2>

<p>It’s pretty simple: The more you drive, the more money you make. Most drivers are paid by the mile rather than hourly or yearly, so not only do they get bonuses for hitting mileage milestones, they also obviously pull in more base-pay money just by stacking up miles.</p></li>

<li><h2>Experience</h2>

<p>As you gain experience and build your reputation in the industry as a solid, dependable, safe driver, carriers will be willing to pay you more for your time (i.e. mileage) and effort. You’ll be able to negotiate a better per-mile pay rate for yourself and, usually, better benefits packages, too.</p></li>

 <li><h2>Type of Driving / Which Carrier</h2>

<p>There are many types of truck driving you could choose to pursue. From Team to Dedicated to Specialized Hauling (flatbed, refrigerated, hazmat, etc.) and more, different companies place different values on each type of driving, depending on their needs. That means the pay, bonuses and benefits you’ll get for the same type of driving will vary from one carrier to the next, just like each type of driving will have varying pay rates within the same carrier company.</p>
 </li>
 </ul>

<p>With all these ways to earn money, and considering the low turn-around time between when you actually decide to get training and when you earn your Class A CDL, the trucking industry is one of the quickest ways to a better life available in the job market today.</p>

<p>At Roadmaster Drivers School, for example, training only takes about 3-4 weeks. That means in less than a month, you could earn a whole new (and very profitable) career.</p>

<h2>Short Term vs Long Run</h2>

<p>As we said, the short term cost of going to truck driving school, getting the proper training and earning your Class A CDL license is relatively low compared to what you stand to make as a professional truck driver.</p>

<p>The way it works at Roadmaster, for example, is that once you complete your training and earn your CDL, you’ll sign with a carrier (and many of our students are even pre-hired by carriers within the first couple weeks of training!). Since Roadmaster works with many of the nation’s top carriers, you’ll be able to find the one that’s right for you. Plus, most of the carriers we work with offer up to 90% tuition reimbursement for those who qualify.</p>

<p>Now, factor in the regular pay, numerous bonuses and strong benefits packages you could earn — packages that often include health, dental and life insurance, 401k, paid vacation and sick time and more — and it’s easy to see why your CDL will likely pay for itself many times over in the long run.</p>

<h2>Down The Road</h2>

<p>Once you’ve gotten your CDL and a few years of experience in the trucking industry, another factor comes into play as far as your salary goes:</p>

<p>Most drivers start their careers as Over-The-Road (OTR), or long-haul, truck drivers. Many choose to continue on that path, but many others eventually switch jobs within the industry. There are a lot of excellent opportunities for CDL drivers, many of which include tons of home time and other great benefits, as well as chances to earn money within different pay structures.</p>

<p>So if you’re ready to get started in a career in Trucking where you can earn great pay and bonuses, have access to solid benefits and enjoy some pretty amazing experiences out on the road, take the first step right now with Roadmaster Drivers School…</p>
