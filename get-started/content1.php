<p>In today’s slowly recovering recession, jobs are a sore subject. Many Americans are seemingly left without plausible options. Young adults find themselves trapped in the limbo of “experience required” while more seasoned Americans are wondering what new career they can possibly invest in after devoting years to another. The good news for everyone is Professional Truck Driving is a career fit for any adult with a clean driving history and a will to succeed.</p>

<p>“The one thing I always tell the students in orientation is that their job is more secure than mine, that every time I look in the newspaper, I see no director jobs available, but I see all kinds of truck driving positions,” says Rich Trivett, the School Director of our Indianapolis Roadmaster facility.</p>

<p>Production rates have spiked in recent years putting producers and distributors in great need of people licensed to transport their goods. Professional Truck Drivers are in high demand and production doesn’t appear to be slowing down anytime soon.</p>

<h2>2. Opportunities For Travel</h2>

<p>Want to see what the sunrise or sunset looks like from all over the continental U.S.? Professional Truck Driving offers individuals the opportunity to travel around the country, seeing natural and American-made marvels that you may not have been privileged to visit otherwise.</p>

<p>Why not wake up on Monday in California and go to bed on Friday in Maine? See Floridian beaches one day and mountainous landscapes another. Professional Truck Driving is an occupation that demands long hours away from home. If traveling and adventure are priorities in your life, though, then this is definitely the career for you.</p>

<h2>3. Relatively Easy-To-Earn Class A CDL</h2>

<p>Courses for Class A CDL training can be found all over the country. While we can’t speak for them all, we can vouch that Roadmaster Drivers School does its best to ensure the learning process is a great experience. But don’t just take our word for it. Rick, a graduate from Roadmaster’s Salt Lake City facility, says: “That’s one thing about Roadmaster: you come in here and you’re not treated like a student. It’s almost like you’re part of a family. I don’t feel like I’m coming to school. I feel like I’m just coming to hangout and learn and do some really cool stuff, and I have some really cool people to do it with. And in the process of all that, I’m going to get a great education out of it. And a great career path! [Roadmaster] gives you all the tools you need to be successful. Period.”</p>

<p>At Roadmaster, students undergo a combination of classroom testing and hands-on training to ensure safety and competency on the road. And many students complete their Class A CDL Training in just three to four weeks!</p>
