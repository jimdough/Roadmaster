<p>Do you want to know how to get a Class A CDL License? Roadmaster Drivers School has <a href="http://www.roadmaster.com/truck_school_locations.php">11 schools nationwide</a> and has trained thousands of professional truck drivers. Let’s go over some of the basic things you need to get started!</p>
<h3>What exactly is a CDL and why do you need it?</h3>
<p>In short, the CDL is a certification that qualifies you to operate heavy machinery.There are a few types of CDL’s; depending on the total weight of the vehicle you will be driving. The <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> (FMSCA) defines Class A and Class B CDL’s as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class A CDL – Any combination of vehicles with a GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 26,001 or more pounds provided the GVWR of the vehicle(s) being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds. This is the one you need to work for major carriers like the ones that Roadmaster works with. (Link to carrier choice and list carriers)</li>
<li>Class B CDL – Any single vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds, or any such vehicle towing a vehicle not in excess of 10,000 pounds GVWR.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commercial Motor Vehicle Act of 1986 requires drivers to take a state exam that proves their skill and knowledge on the road when operating heavy machinery. CDL training is all about keeping the roads safe!</p>

<h3>CDL Requirements</h3>
<p>You can make sure that you’re ready to get your CDL by doing or providing the <a href='https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration/commercial-drivers-license/how-do-i-get-commercial-drivers-license'>following</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>CDL Permit - All states require you to obtain a CDL permit before beginning training. The federal government requires that driving records be checked going back 10 years.</li>
<li>Proof of Identification – Depending on which state you attend training in, you may be asked to provide proof of identification and legal residency. Contact an Admissions Representative for specific requirements for your state.</li>
<li>Pass the CDL exam – This is the last (and arguably most important!) step in getting your CDL. There are a couple parts to the exam, including general knowledge, combinations, pre-trip inspection, and the road test. This covers both written and practical on-the-road material.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re feeling a little lost, don’t worry! Roadmasters’ Admissions Representatives can help you get started and begin your professional truck driving career! <a href="https://secure.livechatinc.com/licence/4004091/open_chat.cgi">Click here to start chatting</a>.</p>

<h3>How do I get my CDL permit?</h3>
<p>Just like with your normal driver’s license, you’ll need a training permit to begin learning how to drive trucks. In this case, you need a CDL permit. You won’t need to go get this on your own, though. Roadmaster instructors will cover the material you need to know before you test for your permit.</p>
