<p>Want to know how to get your CDL in Ohio? We’ve got the answers! Although we can’t put everything you need to know about getting your CDL in Ohio in this article, we can give you some of the basics.</p>
<p>To begin with, what exactly is a <a href="../../cdl_training_class-a.php">Commercial Driver’s License (CDL)</a>? Before the Commercial Motor Vehicle Act of 1986, any driver with a regular license could drive a tractor-trailer on the nation’s highways. The Act required drivers to get special training and certification first to help keep the roads safer for all travelers. <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/">The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> defines the required licenses of truck drivers as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class A CDL</strong> – Any combination of vehicles with a GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 26,001 or more pounds provided the GVWR of the vehicle(s) being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds.</li>
<li><strong>Class B CDL</strong> – Any single vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds, or any such vehicle towing a vehicle not in excess of 10,000 pounds GVWR.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Class A CDL is the one you’ll need to transport freight across the nation. Class A <a href="http://www.roadmaster.com/cdl_training_class-a.php/">CDL training</a> at Roadmaster will teach you the essentials to be a safe, successful truck driver as well as the skills and knowledge needed to pass the CDL exam.</p>

<h2>Ohio CDL Requirements</h2>
<p>There are a few factors that should be at the front of your mind if you want to get your CDL in Ohio. For starters, you will need to provide proof of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Security Number</strong> – You will need to bring official documents that verify your Social Security number in order to get your CDL. All documents (such as Social Security cards or tax documents) must be originals. Copies will not be accepted.</li>
<li><strong>Identification</strong> – Your identification verifies a few necessary things needed to get your CDL: Your full name, which must include the first, middle and last names; your date of birth; and your state of residency. Since the license is issued by the state, you will need to prove you are a resident of Ohio to receive a CDL in Ohio.</li>
<li><strong>Passed CDL Exam</strong> – Your CDL exam is what will finally determine if you are able to get the license or not. The exam is made up of a pre-trip inspection, a knowledge-based questions test, and a skills test where you will demonstrate skill behind the wheel with a prompter.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to earn your CDL in Ohio, you will need to have a clean driving record. Also, federal regulations require you to take a physical examination at least every three years to prove you are healthy enough to drive large trucks. Together, these help to make the roads a safer place!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intrastate</strong> – Driving within the same state. Current regulations require drivers to be 18 years of age to drive a truck in the same state.</span></li>
<li><strong>Interstate</strong> – Driving between states. You must be at least 21 years old to carry freight between states.</li>
</ul>
<p>Required documents are updated over time, so make sure to check with your state DMV for the most up-to-date information. If this seems like a lot to think about, know that Roadmaster is here to help you every step of the way! From learning to shift gears to searching for truck driving jobs, Roadmaster’s industry-expert instructors are there to help you master your career as a trucker!</p>
