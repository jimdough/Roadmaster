<p>If CDL training is on your radar in California, train with Roadmaster to excel in your career in the truck driving industry! Roadmaster has trained thousands of professional truck drivers across the nation and has a California <a href="truck_school_fontanaCalifornia.php">truck driving school location in Fontana</a>. To stay ahead of the game, here are some things you need to know about getting your CDL in California:</p>
<p><a href="cdl_training_class-a.php/">What exactly is a CDL</a> and why do you need it? In short, the CDL is a certification that qualifies you to drive tractor-trailers on the nation’s highways. Before the CDL was created, anyone could drive freight on the highways with only a driver’s license. It wasn’t very safe, but now <a href="what-is-cdl-training.php">CDL training</a> helps protect everyone on the road!</p>
<p>The Commercial Motor Vehicle Act of 1986 requires drivers to take a state CDL test that proves their skill and knowledge on the road when operating heavy machinery. There are a few types of CDL’s, depending on the total weight of the vehicle you will be driving. The <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> (FMSCA) defines Class A and Class B CDL’s as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class A CDL</strong> – Any combination of vehicles with a GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 26,001 or more pounds provided the GVWR of the vehicle(s) being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds. </li>
<li><strong>Class B CDL</strong> – Any single vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds, or any such vehicle towing a vehicle not in excess of 10,000 pounds GVWR.</li>
</ul>

<div class="text-center hide-for-medium-down"> </div>
<h2>CDL Requirements in California</h2>
<p>To get your CDL in California, you’ll need to provide proof of a few documents. Your documents will need to verify:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proof of Identification</strong> – Items like driver’s licenses and identification cards verify your name, but they also verify your age. According to national standards, drivers must be 21 years old to drive interstate (between states) and 18 to drive intrastate (within the same state). </li>
<li><strong>Medical Examination Report</strong> – A medical examination report may be required, depending on the last time you had one performed. A medical examination report from the California DMV <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/fa2a514f-130a-4935-adba-e55ec36e234a/dl51.pdf?MOD=AJPERES">can be found here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Social Security</strong> – Proof of a Social Security number is required in order to get your CDL. As with other proofs of identification, the Social Security documents you bring must be originals and cannot be copies. </li>
<li><strong>Passed CDL Test</strong> – This is what will determine your eligibility to work as a truck driver in the end, so it’s very important! The test covers a mixture of knowledge-based questions and a behind-the-wheel driving exam. Make sure you’re thoroughly prepared the first time around to avoid having to retake the test.</li>
</ul>
<p>Requirements are always subject to change. To make sure that your documentation requirements are up-to-date, check the <a href="http://www.dmv.org/ca-california/apply-cdl.php">California Department of Motor Vehicles</a>.</p>

<h2>How do I get my California CDL permit?</h2>
<p>Just like with a regular driver’s license, you’ll need a permit first to begin learning how to drive trucks. In this case, you’ll need a state CDL permit in California. You won’t have to worry about getting your CDL permit on your own, though. Roadmaster instructors will help you along the process of obtaining a California CDL permit after you arrive!</p>
