<p>Earning your Class A CDL isn’t easy. The Professional Trucking Industry has standards for its drivers, and <strong>it takes time and effort to be ready to pass the CDL exam</strong>.</p>
<p>If you work a full-time or even a part-time job, though, attending a CDL training program can be even more challenging because scheduling issues add another level of stress to the process. Whether you do construction, work in an office or are in charge of handling all of your family’s needs, <strong>there are only 24 hours in a day and sometimes that’s just not enough</strong>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it doesn’t have to be such a struggle! <strong>Roadmaster Drivers School has developed a system to work around your schedule</strong> and to help you achieve your goal of obtaining a CDL-A license.</p>
<h3>Night and Weekend Schedules for CDL Training</h3>
<p>Earning your Class A Commercial Driver’s License (CDL), the required license of Professional Truck Drivers, isn’t as time-consuming as a traditional degree (think <em>two years for an AA, another two for a BA</em>). However, CDL training does require students to complete 160 course hours that involve a mixture of hands-on and in-class lessons.</p>
<p>If you're looking to change careers but don't have the time to take off work to go to school, Roadmaster has <a href="cdl_training.php">solutions for CDL training</a> that work with almost anyone’s schedule!</p>
<h3>Weekend CDL Training Courses</h3>
<p>CDL training in one of Roadmaster’s weekend courses provides all of the same expert knowledge and instruction of a weekday course while not conflicting with weekday schedules. <strong>Weekend programs run 7am-6pm, Saturdays and Sundays, but can vary slightly by region.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine completing Professional Truck Driver training and gaining the knowledge to test for your CDL in just eight short weekends. First year drivers can make $40,000 to $45,000 their first year,* and you could be on your way to a lucrative career in less than two months! </p>
<h3>CDL Night Classes</h3>
<p>Are your weekends busier than most? That's okay! Roadmaster also offers CDL night classes that consist of the same amount of professional training, only broken over a weeknight schedule. </p>
<p>CDL night classes run four weeks straight, <strong>typically operating on a schedule of 6pm-12pm on weekdays</strong>. Maintaining a traditional day schedule while completing CDL training is easy with Roadmaster. Some night class options require the addition of one weekend class a week depending on location. Check with a Roadmaster representative to find out more details. </p>

<h3>Tips on How to Make Time to Go to Truck Driving School</h3>
<p>If you work irregular hours the above options may not make sense for you. However there still are a few ways to fit CDL training into your schedule. They just may require you to get a little creative.</p>
<p>Let’s say you work in a restaurant, retail store or any other industry that may put a shift in the middle of your day. Here are some possible options you may want to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Switch shifts:</strong> If you can pick up extra shifts during the week to clear your weekend, you can train for your CDL on Saturdays and Sundays. Or, if you can switch to night shifts at work, you may be able to attend the regular daytime CDL training.</li>
<li><strong>Save up:</strong> If you are at all able to save up money in advance, you might be able to get through CDL training either without working or by working reduced hours. That could make a huge difference and really open up your schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Finance your personal expenses:</strong> While Roadmaster can help finance your training, you may be able to get a separate loan from your bank in order to cover your bills and other personal expense while you train. Then, you can pay it back when you begin working as a professional truck driver. It may require you to stretch your money a little farther, but taking out a loan could help make that career change a real option if it otherwise isn’t.</li>
<li><strong>If at all possible, consider cutting back to part time:</strong> Obviously, this isn’t the easiest option. But, if you sit down and figure out where you can cut costs in your personal life and make the right sacrifices, you may be able to cut down your hours at work so that you only need to work part time. Then, you could arrange your shifts so they fit better with your CDL training schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these financial suggestions, <strong>you may also want to ask people who are close to you to lend a hand</strong> in other areas of your life. If you have friends, family or neighbors who you trust, it might be worth asking them if they can help babysit or handle other responsibilities that are very important but also time-consuming.</p>
<p><strong>By using all the resources available to you, the challenge of training for your Class A CDL license becomes a little easier</strong>. Night classes and weekend training are two such options that Roadmaster Drivers School has created to help you achieve your goal.</p>
