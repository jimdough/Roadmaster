<h3>You have a choice!</h3>
<p>Roadmaster is a free-choice school, meaning students are free to choose their carrier after graduation and are encouraged to select the best fit for their career goals. While many schools put limits on this selection, Roadmaster students are not contracted or bound to any carrier.  Instead, we focus on prepping students to be the most competent and confident Professional Truck Drivers they can be.</p>
 
<p>The mission of Roadmaster is the same as it has always been – we want each of our graduates to choose the path that is the right choice for their individual needs and situation. At Roadmaster, we understand that not every carrier is the right choice or fit for every new driver entering the Industry.</p>
 
<p>The truth is that drivers become an integral part of the Professional Truck Driving Industry no matter which carrier they choose. Thanks to increased production and distribution, America’s economy is improving every year. We, in turn, can thank our Professional Truck Drivers for their help in moving America forward.</p>

<p>Too frequently, Commercial Drivers License (CDL) training courses lure in students under the promise to offer free schooling in return for contracted service. Most of the times this either isn't the case or the conditions agreed to are manipulated and twisted to benefit the carrier. An accredited CDL training course such as Roadmaster, however, offers its students the choice to make decisions that will optimize their future.</p>
