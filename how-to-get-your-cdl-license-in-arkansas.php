<p>If you’re looking to get your CDL license in Arkansas, truck driver training at Roadmaster is the way to go! With a campus in <a href="truck_school_WESTMEMPHIS.php">West Memphis</a>, Roadmaster will teach you the essential skills and knowledge to pass your CDL exam and become a successful truck driver!</p>
<p>What exactly is a <a href="cdl_training_class-a.php/">Commercial Driver’s License (CDL)</a> and why do you need it? In short, the CDL is a certification that allows you to operate heavy machinery.</p>
<p>There are a few types of CDL’s; depending on the total weight of the vehicle you will be driving. The <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> (FMSCA) defines Class A and Class B CDL’s as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class A CDL</strong> – Any combination of vehicles with a GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 26,001 or more pounds provided the GVWR of the vehicle(s) being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds.</li>
<li><strong>Class B CDL</strong> – Any single vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds, or any such vehicle towing a vehicle not in excess of 10,000 pounds GVWR.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commercial Motor Vehicle Act of 1986 requires drivers to take a state exam that proves their skill and knowledge on the road when operating heavy machinery. <a href="what-is-cdl-training.php">CDL training</a> is all about keeping the roads safe for everyone!</p>
<h2>CDL Requirements in Arkansas</h2>
<p>In order to receive your CDL in Arkansas you will need to provide proof of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age – </strong>You will need to bring a document that verifies your date of birth. According to nationwide standards, drivers who are under 21 can only drive intrastate (within the same state) while drivers who are 21 or over are able to drive interstate (between states).</li>
<li><strong>Identity – </strong>In order to get your CDL, you will need to show proof of your identity by providing evidence of a Social Security number. You can find your identification numbers on documents such as Social Security cards and IRS information (W-2, W-4, 1099, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Written and Skills Test (CDL Exam) – </strong>This is the big one! To get your CDL you’ll need to pass the state test. The CDL exam will cover a mixture of knowledge-based testing as well as hands-on testing scenarios in a truck. This will be your opportunity to show a prompter all the skill you’ve learned at Roadmaster Truck Driving School!</li>
</ul>
<p>If this seems like a lot of information, don’t worry! Roadmasters’ Admissions Representatives will help you get started and on your way to a professional truck driving career in no time!</p>
