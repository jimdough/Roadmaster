<p>Eager to break into the Professional Truck Driving Industry? First, you’ll need to successfully complete a truck driving course and earn your Commercial Driver’s License (CDL). Below, we’ve listed some requirements and expectations of Roadmaster’s truck driver training courses as well as a few of our student policies. </p>
<h3>CDL Class Graduation Requirements</h3>
<p>In order to successfully graduate from Roadmaster Drivers School, students must meet certain requirements, including, among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete all of the pre-determined hours of CDL A training.</li>
<li>Achieve at least a 70% overall grade average.</li>
<li>When a student does not meet specific standards for a phase of training, additional instruction may be required and given.</li>
<li>If additional time is required to achieve an approved level of performance, there will be no extra charge to the student.</li>
<li>Amount of time spent on any field-training topic may vary among students.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Certification of Completion</h3>
<p>Upon graduation, you will receive a Certificate of Completion and assistance in obtaining your CDL.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Texas, students completing the program requirements will receive a Compliance and Completion Certificate.</li>
<li>In Ohio, students completing the program requirements will receive an Ohio Certificate of Completion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Attendance Policy Highlights</h3>

<li>Attendance at each scheduled CDL class is required and recorded.</li>
<li>Students are required to report to class on time.</li>
<li>Absences will be recognized as valid in the event of student illness or death of an immediate family member.</li>
<li>When an absence is authorized, the student will be entitled to make-up classes at no additional cost, although this does not remove the absence.</li>
<li>All missed classes must be made up prior to graduation.</li>
<li>It is the responsibility of the student to schedule make-up time with the Director of Training.</li>

<h3>Incomplete Policy</h3>
<p>Roadmaster students who meet either of the following criteria are eligible for a refund of tuition based on the applicable state refund policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any student not completing the CDL A training within the prescribed time frame</li>
<li>A student who withdraws or is withdrawn from Roadmaster Drivers School</li>
</ul>
<h3>Veteran Policies</h3>
<p>Roadmaster is also approved for veterans training. Student eligibility for Veterans Education Benefits is established by the Veterans Administration. Initial eligibility and continued eligibility during enrollment is determined by the VA. The following policies are applicable to students receiving VA benefits: </p>
<p><strong>Veterans' Attendance Policy Highlights</strong></p>
<p>VA-approved students must adhere to the same attendance policy as other students attending Roadmaster Truck Drivers School. In addition to the attendance policy stated in the official catalog, students receiving VA benefits in order to attend Roadmaster Truck Drivers School must also adhere to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excused absences will be granted for extenuating circumstances only and must be substantiated by entries on the student’s academic file.</li>
<li>Legitimate documentation of why the absence occurred must be turned in to the Director of Training within a week of the absence.</li>
<li>Students missing 20% or more of the program will be dismissed. Absences are counted in exact time increments (2 hours absent equals 2 hours toward the 20% maximum). </li>
</ul>
<h3>Standards of Satisfactory Progress for VA-Approved Students</h3>
<p>Students receiving VA benefits are required to maintain satisfactory progress in order to remain in good academic standing. Satisfactory Academic Progress for VA students is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A veteran must maintain an overall grade point average of at least a C, seventy percent (70%), at the end of each grading period.</li>
<li>If the cumulative grade point average falls below a C, seventy percent (70%), the student will be placed on probation for the next evaluation period.</li>
<li>If the grade point average remains below seventy percent (70%) at the end of the next evaluation period, the VA will be notified of the probation, thus leading to the termination of the benefits.</li>
<li>VA students may request reinstatement after a full term of dismissal has passed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Veterans' Refund Policy</h3>
<p>In the event that veterans or their eligible persons sponsored as students under Chapters 30, 32, 35 of Title 38 and Chapter 1606 or Title 10 U.S. Code, fail to enter the Program or withdraw or are discontinued therefrom at any time prior to completion, the amount charged for tuition, fees, and other charges shall not exceed the approximate pro rata portion of the total charges for tuition, fees, and other charges that the length of the non-accredited program bears to its total length. A registration fee of $10 need not be refundable: any amount beyond that is subject to pro ration and refund (CFR 21.4254(c)(13). The pro rata portion may not vary more than 10 percent of the total costs for tuition, fees, and other charges.</p>
