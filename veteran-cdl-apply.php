<h3>Getting the Benefits Started</h3>

<p>In order to get the benefits started, the veteran or other eligible person will need to file an appropriate application.  For veterans who have never used their benefits, the appropriate application is VA Form 22-1990 or VA Form 22-5490 for other eligible dependents.  For veterans who have used their benefits previously, the appropriate application is VA Form 22-1995 or VA Form 22-5495 for other eligible dependents. Please have the veteran or other eligible person submit the appropriate application over the Internet. This will ensure that there will be no interruption in Muskogee receiving the application. The applications can be found at www.gibill.va.gov. There is a link on the front page to apply for VA education benefits. In addition to the veteran or other eligible dependent completing an application, you must complete an enrollment certification form (VA Form 22-1999). </p>

<h3>Who to contact if problems arise</h3>
<p><b>Payments:</b> If your trainee is experiencing problems with their VA education payments or has other questions about their VA Educational Benefits they should call our toll free number at 1-888-442-4551 for assistance.</p>

<h3>Veterans Refund Policy</h3>
<p>The refund of the unused portion of tuition, fees, and other charges for veterans or eligible persons who fail to enter a course, withdraw or discontinue prior to completion, will be made for all amounts paid which exceed the approximate pro rata portion of the total charges that the length of the completed portion bears to the total length of the course. The proration will be determined on the ratio of days or hours of instruction completed to the total number of instructional days or hours in the course.</p>
