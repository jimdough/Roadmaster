<p>Making the move from the military to civilian life? Transitioning from a career in the military back into the civilian world can be a stressful period of your life. Veterans leaving the service often struggle to match their skills with a civilian career. The good news is that the truck driving industry is experiencing tremendous growth! The number of truck drivers needed to fill these positions in the next ten years is <a href="http://www.trucking.org/ATA%20Docs/News%20and%20Information/Reports%20Trends%20and%20Statistics/10%206%2015%20ATAs%20Driver%20Shortage%20Report%202015.pdf">expected to reach 175,000</a>. The disciplined, get-it-done mindset that our armed forces instills in its service men and women has proven to be an ideal match for truck driver training and a career as a CDL professional.</p>
<p>Truck driving and truck drivers are the life blood of our country as more than 80 percent of all U.S. communities depend solely on trucking for delivery of their goods and commodities**. Professional truck drivers serve America everyday by providing the goods we use from toothbrushes to tires – you served your country, now help us keep America moving! If you would like to find out even more of the <a href="trucking_benefits.php">benefits</a> of obtaining a <a href="cdl_training_class-a.php">Class A CDL license</a> and attending <strong>truck driver training</strong>, contact an admissions representative by <a href="contact.php">applying now</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>Roadmaster truck driver training school is approved for Veterans Training and our students, if qualified, are eligible for Post 9/11 benefits</li>
<li>As a full-time truck driving employee, you can enjoy the benefits that full-time drivers are offered such as medical &amp; life insurance, 401k, paid holidays, vacations, and plenty of opportunities for advancement.</li>
<li>First year drivers average $40,000 to $45,000 their first year.*</li>
<li>A majority of professional truck drivers are able to get home weekly to their families</li>
</ul>

<h3>Veteran Policies</h3>
<p>Student eligibility for <a href="http://www.gibill.va.gov/">Veterans Education Benefits</a> is established by the <a href="http://www.va.gov/">Veterans Administration</a>. Initial eligibility and continued eligibility during enrollment is determined by the VA.</p>
<h3>Veterans’ Refund Policy</h3>
<p>The refund of the unused portion of tuition, fees, and other charges for veterans or eligible persons who fail to enter a course, withdraw or discontinue prior to completion, will be made for all amounts paid which exceed the approximate pro rata portion of the total charges that the length of the completed portion bears to the total length of the course. The proration will be determined on the ratio of days or hours of instruction completed to the total number of instructional days or hours in the course.</p>
<h3>What Is A Veteran CDL Skills Test Waiver</h3>
<p>A veteran CDL skills test waiver is basically a way for former military drivers to prove that they’ve had enough practical skills training in the form of driving comparable vehicles while serving in the military. Those who qualify for the waiver are able to skip the skills testing that many civilians would need to successfully complete before earning a Class A CDL.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration/commercial-drivers-license/military">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s (FMCSA) website:</a></p>
<blockquote>“In May 2011, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration finalized the Commercial Learner’s Permit rule. Within that rule is a provision that gives State Driver Licensing Agencies (SDLAs) the authority to substitute two years of CMV safe driving experience in military equivalents of commercial motor vehicles, for the skills test portion of the commercial driver license skills test. Military drivers must apply within one year of separation from active duty."</blockquote>
<p>So, basically, if you drove certain military vehicles and meet a few other requirements, you can get your Class A CDL license sooner than later. What are those other requirements? Well… </p>
<h3>Qualifications For A Veteran CDL Skills Test Waiver</h3>
<p>First, you should make sure your state offers the military skills test waiver. You can do that by <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/sites/fmcsa.dot.gov/files/docs/Military-Skills-Test-Map-06-25-14.pdf">clicking here</a> and checking the map page on the FMCSA’s website.</p>
<p>The FMSCA's website also explains:</p>
<blockquote>"The regulation, 49 CFR 383.77, provides guidance for SDLAs that requires the applicant to certify:
<ul>
<li>His/her safe driving experience;</li>
<li>That he or she has not held more than one license (except a military DL) in the past two years;</li>
<li>Has not had his/her base State issued driver license suspended, revoked or cancelled; and,</li>
<li>Has not had convictions in any type of motor vehicle for the disqualifying CDL offenses listed elsewhere in the regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also other requirements that States must recognize in order to take advantage of this Skills Test Waiver, but the process allows States to assist veterans and active duty personnel in their transition from their military occupation to a civilian career. As more and more of our military troops return home from active duty, the Department of Transportation and FMCSA have joined with the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Veterans Affairs to ease this process.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve made sure your state offers the waiver and are ready to show that you meet all the necessary requirements, including the above qualifications, the next step is to get the ball rolling by filling out the official application form for the waiver, which you can get by <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/sites/fmcsa.dot.gov/files/docs/7-1-2014-FINAL-APPLICATION-FOR-MILITARY-SKILLS-TEST-WAIVER-5-15-2012.pdf">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p> If you have any questions, please be sure to check with your State Driver Licensing Agency.</p>

<h3>Do I Still Need Training If I Get The Veteran CDL Skills Test Waiver?</h3>
<p>This is the tricky part. See, a lot of former military drivers are more familiar with automatic than with standard transmissions. This can impact those veterans’ ability to get hired because civilian employers generally prefer their employees to have standard shift experience.</p>
<p>The best course of action for veterans in this situation is to apply for the waiver for the sake of bypassing some of the testing, while still attending Roadmaster in order to learn how to shift and drive according to various current industry standards, preferences and requirements.</p>
<h3>What If I <em>Don’t </em>Qualify For A Veteran CDL Skills Test Waiver</h3>
<p>The good news is that in either case — whether you qualify for the waiver or not — Roadmaster Drivers School can help veterans to achieve their goals. </p>
<p>For example, Roadmaster proudly accepts the <strong>Post 9/11 GI Bill</strong> Benefit. That means that, for those veterans who qualify, your training could be paid for in recognition of your service.</p>
<p>As for the time it takes to earn your Class A CDL and begin your new career, Roadmaster offers the advantage of completing our comprehensive CDL training program in <a href="http://notkatehardcastle.local:5757/blog/3-4-weeks-truck-driver-training-school-enough/">as few as four weeks</a>!</p>
<p>So whether you qualify for the veteran CDL skills test waiver or not, we recommend you get on the road to success today by signing up for Roadmaster’s accelerated training course.</p>
<h3>Getting The Benefits Started</h3>
<p>In order to get the benefits started, the veteran or other eligible person will need to file an appropriate application. For veterans who have never used their benefits, the appropriate application is VA Form 22-1990 or VA Form 22-5490 for other eligible dependents. For veterans who have used their benefits previously, the appropriate application is VA Form 22-1995 or VA Form 22-5495 for other eligible dependents.</p>
<p>Please have the veteran or other eligible person submit the appropriate application over the Internet. This will ensure that there will be no interruption in Muskogee receiving the application. The applications can be found at <a href="http://www.gibill.va.gov">http://www.gibill.va.gov</a>. There is a link on the front page to apply for VA education benefits. In addition to the veteran or other eligible dependent completing an application, you must complete an enrollment certification form (VA Form 22-1999). </p>
<h3>Who To Contact If Problems Arise</h3>
<p>Payments: If you experience problems with your VA education payments or have other questions about your VA Educational Benefits then you should call the VA's toll free number at 1-888-442-4551 for assistance.</p>
