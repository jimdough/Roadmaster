<p>Job Placement at Roadmaster is a resource given to trainees for the length of their career at no additional charge. With the help of our friendly industry experts, trainees learn the process of submitting an application to a carrier. Instructors guide students through the applications and see that trainees <a href="cdl_training_class-a.php">earning their CDL</a> are given a choice of <a href="carrier-choice.php">top-name carriers</a> to apply to. </p>
<h2>CDL Job Placement</h2>
<ul>
<li>Starts on the very first day of orientation so trainees can learn and apply trucking knowledge <em>day one</em>.</li>
<li>Instructors go over mock applications with trainees and show them through the document, teaching critical skills.</li>
<li>Trainees fill out mock applications to the best of their knowledge.</li>
<li>Instructors follow up, typically through a one-on-one, to go over the mock application with trainees for completeness and correctness.</li>
<li>Trainees are given a selection of carrier applications and can browse and choose which company roles best fit their preferred lifestyle.</li>
<li>The corrected mock application serves as a guide for trainees to use as they fill out actual applications for real CDL positions. Instructors are on hand should questions come up. </li>
<li>Carriers respond quickly and representatives visit the school to speak with trainees as training continues. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Pre-Hired during Truck Driving School</h2>
<p>Representatives from top-name carriers make frequent visits to Roadmaster facilities, typically with at least one rep from a core carrier visiting each week. This way, trainees can learn more about carriers and can interact with other industry professionals and ask important career questions.</p>
<p>From the carrier standpoint, representatives can come check out potential future talent and sell their best pitch. There is <a href="truck-driver-shortage.php">a big demand for Class A CDL trained truck drivers</a>, and carriers compete with each other and provide interested drivers incentives and <a href="trucking_benefits.php">great benefits</a>. Look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competitive starting salary</strong> – First year drivers average $40,000-$45,000 their first year!*</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better perks</strong> – Paid vacation, paid sick leave, medical and dental insurance, <a href="trucking_benefits.php">and more!</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>More opportunities to earn money</strong> – Advantages such as being able to accept longer trips or clock longer hours for extra pay</li>
</ul>

<p>A pre-hire letter is an invitation from carriers to visit their orientation once you complete CDL training and earn your Class A CDL license. The letter states that you meet the company's hiring requirements and that they are interested in employing you as a driver. If the carrier feels that the trainee isn't prepared for a position with their company after orientation, they may not offer a contract.  </p>
<p>Pre-hiring is big news for any future truck driver! Instead of worrying about job placement, you could sign on with a renowned carrier in your first week of classes at Roadmaster! Imagine landing a coveted position in the truck driving industry with a leading carrier in a matter of days! Regardless of whether you decide to take the job, you could have an actual job offer (pre-hire letter) in your hand to compare other offers against.</p>

<h2>Job Placement in the Future</h2>
<p>More good news about training with Roadmaster is that graduates will always have job placement assistance. Upon graduation, students are given a contact that can be used to apply to new positions anytime in their trucking future. After contacting Roadmaster, former graduates will be re-interviewed to determine new options for carrier placement and will proceed from there. </p>
