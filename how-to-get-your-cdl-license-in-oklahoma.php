<h1>How To Get Your CDL in Oklahoma</h1>
<p>Are you looking to get your CDL in Oklahoma? Roadmaster’s campus in <a href="truck_school_tulsa.php">Tulsa, Oklahoma</a> combines expert instruction with comprehensive training to help you succeed as a Class A CDL-trained truck driver! </p>
<p>For starters, what is a <a href="cdl_training_class-a.php">Commercial Driver’s License (CDL)</a>? Well, prior to the Commercial Motor Vehicle Act of 1986, any citizen with a regular driver’s license could drive a tractor-trailer on the highways. This new act required drivers to get special training and certification before they operate heavy machinery to help keep the roads safer for all drivers. <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/">The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> defines the required licenses of truck drivers as: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class A CDL</strong> – Any combination of vehicles with a GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 26,001 or more pounds provided the GVWR of the vehicle(s) being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds.</li>
<li><strong>Class B CDL</strong> – Any single vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds, or any such vehicle towing a vehicle not in excess of 10,000 pounds GVWR.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your goal is to become a truck driver that carries freight, the Class A CDL is the one you need to get! Class A <a href="http://www.ait-schools.com/blog/what-is-cdl-training/">CDL training</a> at Roadmaster will help you become a safe, successful truck driver as well as teach you skills and knowledge needed to pass your CDL exam.</p>
<h2>CDL Requirements in Oklahoma</h2>
<p>Here are some basic Oklahoma CDL requirements, including a couple of documents that will be needed. All of the verification documents you bring must be original copies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identification</strong> – You will need to prove your date of birth as well as your full name (including first, middle, and last). Current regulations require drivers to be 18 years of age to drive a truck in the same state (intrastate) and 21 to drive it between states (interstate).</li>
<li><strong>Residency</strong> – In addition to having to verify your identification, you will need to verify you are a resident of Oklahoma to get a CDL in the state. For a list of accepted documents, you can visit the <a href="https://www.dps.state.ok.us/dls/">Oklahoma Department of Public Safety</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Requirements change over time, so make sure to check with your state DMV to get the most up-to-date information. If this all seems like a lot, don’t worry! Roadmaster is there to help you every step of the way to make sure you get the best Class A CDL training around!</p>

Our expert instructors will help you along the process shortly after arriving. And when you’re finished with training, you can trade in your permit for an actual CDL!</p>
