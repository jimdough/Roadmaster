<h6>Veterans' Attendance Policy Highlights</h6>

<h6>Standards of Satisfactory Progress for VA-Approved Students</h6>

<ul>
  <li>A veteran must maintain an overall grade point average of at least a C, seventy percent (70%), at the end of each grading period.</li>
  <li>If the cumulative grade point average falls below a C, seventy percent (70%), the student will be placed on probation for the next evaluation period.</li>
  <li>If the grade point average remains below seventy percent (70%) at the end of the next evaluation period, the VA will be notified of the probation, thus leading to the termination of the benefits.</li>
  <li>VA students may request reinstatement after a full term of dismissal has passed.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Veterans' Refund Policy</h6>
<p>The refund of the unused portion of tuition, fees and other charges for veterans or eligible persons who fail to enter a course, withdraw or discontinue prior to completion will be made for all amounts paid which exceed the approximate pro rata portion of the total charges that the length of the completed portion bears to the total length of the course.
