<h4 style="color: #295d87; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.1em;">&amp; Why the Transition Makes Sense for You...</h4>
<p>Whether you're ready to spend more <b>time at your home</b> with your family, or you're just ready for a <b>new challenge and a change of pace</b>, becoming a Roadmaster CDL Instructor is a great way to switch careers without leaving the trucking industry behind and starting all over again.</p>
<p>As an Instructor, you'll put those <b>same skills you've developed as an over-the-road driver</b> to good use. The only difference? Instead of retracing old routes, you'll be teaching new drivers how to take to the road and master the challenge!</p>
<h3 style="padding-top: 1em;">What's So Special About Roadmaster Instructors?</h3>
<h4 style="color: #295d87; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.1em;">Here's what sets Roadmaster Instructors apart from the rest...</h4>
<p>Roadmaster CDL Instructors are <b>highly respected</b> in the industry for their <b>talent</b> and <b>integrity</b>. That's why the top trucking carriers across the US specifically seek out Roadmaster Drivers School graduates!</p>
<p>It's also why, as a member of the Roadmaster team, you'll head off to work each morning with a <b>sense of purpose</b> knowing you're about to <b>have a meaningful impact</b> on a group of new drivers.</p></div><!-- End Column 2 -->
