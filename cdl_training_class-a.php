<p>In short, a <strong>Commercial Driver's License (CDL)</strong> shows carriers and employers that you are a certified and competent Professional Truck Driver.</p>
<p>Operating certain commercial motor vehicles requires specialized skills and knowledge. Prior to implementation of the Commercial Driver's License Program, anyone with a license to drive a car could also legally drive a tractor-trailer or a bus in a number of states. In circumstances where a classified licensing system was available, students weren't tested in vehicles similar to the kind they'd use. As a result, many drivers were operating motor vehicles that they may not have been qualified to drive.</p>
<h3>Why do I need a CDL?</h3>
<p>The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 was signed into law on October 27, 1986. The goal of the Act is to improve highway safety by ensuring that drivers of large trucks and buses are qualified to operate those vehicles and to remove unsafe and unqualified drivers from the highways.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/">Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)</a> has developed and issued standards for testing and licensing commercial motor vehicle drivers. Among other things, the standards require states to issue a Class A CDL to a commercial motor vehicle driver only after the driver passes knowledge and skills tests administered by the state related to the type of vehicle to be operated. Drivers need a CDL license if they are in interstate, intrastate, or foreign commerce.</p>
<h3>What type of CDL do I need?</h3>
<p>While the type of license is dependent on the branch of work you're looking to pursue, Roadmaster courses are geared towards Class A and Class B CDLs, which are required of over-the-road (OTR) Professional Truck Drivers.</p>

<h3>How do a Class A CDL and a Class B CDL differ?</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a>, the Federal standard requires states to issue a CDL (Commercial Drivers License) to drivers according to the following license classifications:</p>
<p><strong>Class A CDL Training</strong> - Any combination of vehicles with a GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds provided the GVWR of the vehicle(s) being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds. Careers that require a Class A CDL include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interstate Tractor Trailer Driver</li>
<li>Intrastate Tractor Trailer Driver </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class B CDL Training</strong> - Any single vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds, or any such vehicle towing a vehicle not in excess of 10,000 pounds GVWR. Careers that require a <strong>Class B CDL License</strong> include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervisors</li>
<li>Heavy truck and tractor-trailer drivers</li>
<li>Hauling specialty cargo</li>
<li>Auto-transport drivers</li>
<li>Furniture delivery</li>
<li>Dispatcher</li>
<li>Self-employed truck driver</li>
<li>Local driver</li>
<li>Store delivery driver</li>
<li>Truck driver training instructor</li>
<li>Cement and concrete production</li>
<li>Courier</li>
<li>Bus driver</li>
<li>Supply company delivery</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roadmaster</strong> truck driving school offers Class A CDL training in all of its <a href="truck_school_locations.php">truck driving school locations</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Roadmaster</strong> Drivers School offers Class B CDL training and testing in all truck driving schools except San Antonio, Indianapolis, and North Carolina.</p>
<h3>How do I get my Commercial Driver's License?</h3>
<p>States are able to issue a CDL license only after a written and driving test have been given by the state or approved testing facility.</p>
<p><strong>It's important to train for your CDL exam for two reasons</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The test itself can be extremely difficult to pass without the proper training.</li>
<li>Many carriers won't hire a candidate without proper training, even if you've passed the CDL exam.</li>
</ul>
